            In CS 106A, we'll be using Stanford's customized version of Eclipse to build our programs. Eclipse is an enormously popular industrial strength Java environment with many features. Fortunately, Eclipse is also open source -- anyone is free to change Eclipse to work the way they want. We have taken advantage of that freedom to install special Stanford features into Eclipse, tailoring it specifically for CS 106A. This document gives instructions on how to get started using Stanford Eclipse. Please pay close attention to these instructions and do not skip steps!
            <br />
            <br /> If you run into any trouble installing Eclipse, please feel free to stop by the Eclipse Troubleshooting session.

<!-- Mac-specific instructions -->
<h2>Installing Eclipse on a Mac</h2>
<p>
	Our version of Eclipse will only work on macOS 10.6 (2009) or higher. If you don't have a supported version of the operating system, you'll need to either upgrade or do your class work on a cluster machine. You can check your version of macOS using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260">these instructions</a>.
</p>
<ol>
	<!-- These instructions are Mac-specific -->
    <li>
    	<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/jdk_mac.dmg">Download and install the Java SDK for Mac</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    	<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/eclipse_mac.tar.gz">Download the Mac version of Eclipse</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    	Click on the downloaded <strong>eclipse_mac.tar</strong> file to unarchive Eclipse (You can delete <strong>eclipse_mac.tar</strong> afterwards).
    </li>
    <li>
    	Drag the Eclipse app into the Applications folder on your Mac.
    </li>
    <li>
    	Drag the Eclipse icon from there to your Dock to create a shortcut.
    </li>
    <li>
    	Click on the icon in the Dock to open Eclipse. If you see an error that says Eclipse "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer," right-click on the Eclipse icon and select "open" instead. You will be able to open Eclipse without right-clicking from now on.
    </li>

    When you run Eclipse for the first time, you may get a screen that looks like this:

    <img style="width:50rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/workspace.png" alt="Eclipse Workspace Launcher dialog" />
    <br/> A workspace is just a directory that Eclipse will use to place new projects in. In 106A you won't have to make any new projects from scratch. We will always give you skeleton projects for your assignments, so you don't need to worry about where the workspace is. The suggested location is fine. Click the <strong>Use this as the default and do not ask again</strong> checkbox, and then click OK.
</li>
<li>
    Now we need to install the "Stanford Plugin".  Once Eclipse has started, click Help -&gt; Install New Software.
</li>
<li>
    In the "Work with" text box, type <strong>https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/plugin</strong> and press Enter.
</li>
<li>
    Click "Select All," then click Next.

</li>
<li>
    Click Yes when asked to restart Eclipse.
</li>
<li>
    Finally, we need to change one Eclipse setting.  By default, Eclipse hides (or "folds") the program comment at the top of each code file; we want to have those always be visible.  To change this, first open <strong>Eclipse preferences</strong> (Eclipse -> Preferences on Mac or Windows -> Preferences on Windows).  In the filter text box, type <strong>folding</strong>.

<h2>Importing and Running Projects</h2>
<p>
    Now that you have set up Eclipse, it's time to work on a project! For each CS 106A assignment, we will provide a skeletal framework called a <strong>starter project</strong>. Using starter projects makes your life much easier by allowing you to ignore the many details involved in creating a project from scratch. Therefore, for each assignment your first task will be to download the starter project from the class website and then import it into your workspace. Once you do that, you can work on your project.  These steps also apply to code from lecture, which will also be provided via a project you import.
</p>
<h3>Importing Projects</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Download the project you wish to import. For example, assignment starter projects are accessible via the "Assignments" dropdown at the top, while lecture code projects are accessible via the "Lectures" dropdown and section code projects via the "Section" dropdown.
    </li>
    <li>
        The starter project will download as a zip file (e.g. <strong>Assignment1.zip</strong>). Expand the zip file. In some cases, this may happen automatically when you download it. Move the resulting folder to where you would like to save it on your computer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Launch Eclipse, and from the Stanford Menu at the top select "Import Project" (or look for an icon like the one below in the Eclipse toolbar).
        <br/>

    </li>
    <li>
        Select the project you would like to import by clicking the topmost <strong>Browse...</strong> button and navigating to the folder from the earlier steps. Then click <strong>OK</strong>.
        <br/>

    </li>
    <li>
        Now, make sure that the check box labeled "Copy projects into workspace" is <strong>unchecked</strong>, and then click the <strong>Finish</strong> button to import the project.
        <br/>

        <br/> Note that if you are unable to import the project, and it appears grayed-out in the "Projects" list, it may be because you already have a project in Eclipse with the same name. You must delete the existing project (right-click on it in the sidebar and select <strong>Delete</strong>) before importing the new one.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should now see the project in the left "Package Explorer" sidebar, like in the image below. Double-click on the project folder to expand its contents.
        <br/>
        <img style="width:50rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/importStep3.png" alt="Package Explorer" />
        <br /> The <strong>lib</strong> folder contains the Stanford Library file, and the <strong>src</strong> folder contains the <strong>.java</strong> code files for this assignment. The <strong>res</strong> folder, if applicable, contains resources files such as images and sounds.  Karel projects also have a <strong>worlds</strong> folder containing the worlds for the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Double-click on <strong>src</strong>, and within that double-click on the <strong>default package</strong>, to show the code files for the assignment. Then double-click on any code file to open it in the main editor window.
        <br/>
        <img style="width:50rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/importStep4.png" alt="Open code file" />
        <br /> 
        When you're ready to run your program, see the instructions in the next section.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Running Projects</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	    To run a program in your project, look for the "running person" icons in the top toolbar.  
	    <br/>
	    <img style="width:25rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/runIcons.png" alt="Run Icons" />
	</li>
	<li>
		The "fast" running person immediately runs the most recently-run program (convenient when focusing on a single program), and the "slow" running person displays a list of all programs imported into Eclipse, like the following:
		<br/>
		<img style="width:50rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/runProgram.png" alt="Run Program" />
		<br/>
		Note that a single project can contain several different programs.  Select the program you would like to run, and it will launch!
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Closing Projects</h3>
<p>
	When you are done with a project and no longer wish to edit or run it, you can <strong>close</strong> it.  Closing the project does not delete the project, but tells Eclipse to no longer display that project's programs in the list of programs you can choose to run.  This may be helpful later in the quarter when you have several projects imported.  To do this, right-click on the project in the sidebar and select <strong>Close Project</strong>.
	<br/>
	<img style="width:30rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/closeProject.png" alt="Close Project" />
	<br/>
	Its folder icon will change to a "closed" folder.  If you would like to reopen a project later, simply double-click on its folder in the sidebar again.

<h2>Submitting Projects</h2>
<p>
	You submit all assignments directly through Eclipse. We check whether an assignment is turned in on time from the time we receive your electronic submission, which is timestamped in the submission process. That time is based on the time on the server that receives the assignment, so it pays to submit things with a few minutes to spare, particularly if you discover that your computer's clock is running slow.
	<br />
	To submit a project in Eclipse, follow these steps:
	<ol>
		<li>
			From the <strong>Stanford Menu</strong> dropdown at the top, select <strong>Submit Project</strong> (or look for an icon like the one below in the Eclipse toolbar).
			<br/>
			<img style="width:25rem" src="//web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1178/img/eclipse/stanfordMenuSubmit.png" alt="Stanford Menu" />
		</li>
		<li>
			Enter your SUNet ID and password, and then click the <strong>Authenticate</strong> button.  Then click <strong>Next</strong>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Select the assignment number for which you are making a submission, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Select the project in Eclipse you would like to submit by clicking <strong>Browse...</strong> and selecting from among the current open projects in Eclipse.  Select the project you would like to submit and click <strong>OK</strong>.  This will submit all files in this project together.
		</li>
		<li>
			The name of your project should now appear in the box labeled "Project:".  Click the <strong>Finish</strong> button to submit.  It may take some time for your project to be fully submitted.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once your project is submitted, you will get a message saying the submission was successful.  Click <strong>OK</strong>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>IMPORTANT: always make sure that your files were successfully submitted.</strong> You can do this by going to <a href="https://paperless.stanford.edu">paperless.stanford.edu</a>; this will show the files your section leader will see when grading your submission.  This is also where your section leader will post your assignment grades and comments.  Remember that <strong>You are responsible for double-checking Paperless to make sure that your files were submitted properly.</strong>  Note that Paperless's web viewer may only display your <strong>.java</strong> files; however, if you download the submission from Paperless you can confirm that your other files are submitted as well.
		</li>
	</ol>

	You can submit as many times as you'd like - your section leader will grade your <i>most recent</i> submission.
	<br />
	<br />

	<strong>IMPORTANT: remember to keep a backup copy of your work.</strong>  Although we work hard to keep track of all assignment submissions, on occasion assignments are not received as expected, and we will ask you to resubmit.  <strong>You are responsible for keeping a backup copy of your work, in the event that a resubmission is required</strong>.  We highly recommend saving backup copies as well, using an external hard drive, a thumb drive, online storage services, etc.  See <a href="https://stutech-help.stanford.edu/hc/en-us/articles/211752126-What-should-I-do-to-backup-my-computer-">here</a> for other recommended ways to back up your data.
