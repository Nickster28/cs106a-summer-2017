Lecture Feedback
-
As mentioned in lecture today, as a small portion of your section participation grade we are asking each student to provide brief feedback on **2 assigned lectures** throughout the quarter.  The feedback should only take a few minutes, and will be used to understand how the course is going, and to help make it better.  You will receive an email with a link to the feedback form **before lecture** on each day to which you are assigned.  We greatly appreciate any feedback you have to improve the course!
