Regular section signups have concluded, and we have finalized section assignments; you should receive an email from your section leader this evening.

If you missed regular section signups, you may sign up using the late signup form in the "Section" dropdown at the top.  Any SCPD students who missed the opportunity to sign up for a grader should do so also via the "Section" dropdown at the top.
