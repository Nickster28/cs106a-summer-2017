Help Hours
-
As a reminder, LaIR helper hours and office hours started yesterday, and are available if you need help on your first assignment, or if you have any questions about the material.  The LaIR is in the first floor of Tresidder Union (in the food court area - sign up for help at the computer in the back) and is open **Sun - Wed 7PM-11PM**.  Rishi and Nick's office hours times are listed in the sidebar to the left.

If you visit the LaIR, you will have the option to sign up for 3 different _queues_ to most efficiently get help:

1. **2-minute queue:** Sign up for the 2 minute queue if you have a quick 2-minute question a course staff member can help you with.
2. **CLaIR queue:** Sign up for the "Conceptual LaIR" (CLaIR) queue if you have a conceptual question about an assignment or material.  Note that _you are not allowed to ask questions about your code_ (e.g. debugging questions) in the CLaIR queue; only conceptual questions.
3. **Standard queue:** Sign up for the standard queue if you have a question that does not fit in the above categories, such as a more in-depth debugging question about your code.
