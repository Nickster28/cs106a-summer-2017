Debugging with Karel
-
Since we did not have much time to cover the Eclipse debugger during lecture on Wednesday, we have posted instructions and a handout walkthrough to help you get more familiar with debugging using Eclipse.  There are two new resources that may come in handy:

1. **Instructions on how to use the Eclipse debugger:** these are in a new section added to the Eclipse page, linked to on the left.
2. **A "Debugging with Karel" handout:** this is a new handout in the "Handouts" dropdown at the top.  This handout walks you through debugging a sample buggy Roomba Karel program using the Eclipse debugger functionality outlined in the above online instructions.

We ***highly*** recommend you read through both of these resources to help you when working on Assignment 1.  Knowing how to use the debugger is a valuable skill that will help you find and fix bugs more quickly.  Moreover, if you run into bugs, you should try finding and fixing them yourself first before reaching out for help at the LaIR or office hours; in particular, at helper hours we will ask what you have first tried on your own to fix the issue you are having.

Good luck working on Assignment 1!
