Lecture Feedback
-
Thank you to everyone who has given feedback on some or all of their 2 assigned lectures this quarter (if you have not been emailed yet, your assigned lectures have not come up yet).  We really appreciate your feedback and have been working to incorporate it as much as possible.  If, at any point, you would like to provide quick feedback on a lecture **besides the days to which you are assigned**, please feel free - we would greatly appreciate it!  The feedback link can be found in the "Lectures" dropdown at the top.
