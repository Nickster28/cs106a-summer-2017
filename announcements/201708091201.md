The Honor Code
-
As mentioned in class today during the Honor Code discussion, if you wish to retract any of your assignments for any reason whatsoever, please **send Nick an email** (email at left) saying which assignment(s) you wish to retract.  We will, no questions asked, retract that assignment and give you a 0 for that assignment.  In particular, if there were any Honor Code issues with that assignment, retracting will remove it and we will no longer consider it an Honor Code issue.  Note that you may not retract just parts of assignments, and we do not provide an opportunity to redo that assignment.  The deadline to retract an assignment is **Tuesday, August 15 @ 1PM**.

If you have any questions about the Honor Code, please see the Honor Code handout under the "Handouts" tab.  Also feel free to come talk to us if you have any questions about the Honor Code, retractions, or anything else.
