CS 106A Lunches
-
Next week on **Wednesday, 8/16 @ 12PM** and **Thursday, 8/17 @ 12PM**, we will be hosting "CS 106A lunches"!  These are informal lunches with the course staff to give you a chance to get lunch, hang out, and ask any questions you may have (about anything!).  Rishi and Nick will be attending, as well as various Section Leaders from both 106A and 106B (the followup course to CS 106A).  Each lunch will be at a different dining hall on campus, and details will be announced early next week.  If you have any financial concerns about attending, please contact Nick or Rishi.
