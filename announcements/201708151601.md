CS 106A Lunches
-
This week, we will be hosting "CS 106A lunches"!  These are informal lunches with the course staff to give you a chance to get lunch, hang out, and ask any questions you may have (about anything!).  Rishi and Nick will be attending, as well as various Section Leaders from both 106A and 106B (the followup course to CS 106A).  The lunches will be at the following times and locations:

1. **Wednesday, August 16, 11:30AM-12:30PM** @ [Arrillaga Family Dining Commons](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?id=06-250&lat=37.4254046&lng=-122.16406057&zoom=17&srch=arrillaga%20family)
2. **Thursday, August 17, 11:30AM-12:30PM** @ [Lakeside (Lag) Dining](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?id=05-010G&lat=37.42469633&lng=-122.17638039&zoom=17&srch=lakeside%20dining)

Students must swipe themselves in, but anyone is welcome, even those without meal plans.  If you have any financial concerns about attending, please contact Nick or Rishi.  Please meet at the entrance in each dining hall where you swipe in.
