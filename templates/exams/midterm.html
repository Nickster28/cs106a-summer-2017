                    The CS106A final exam is Monday, July 24 from 7PM to 9PM. We will provide more details (what the exam covers, practice exams) closer to the exam.

                    If you have OAE accommodations, or if you have an academic or University conflict with this time, and absolutely cannot make the regularly scheduled midterm, you must send a request by email to the instructor by 5:00PM on Monday, July 17 to arrange an alternate exam time. Please include in your email all the possible times you are able to take the exam from Sunday, July 23 to Tuesday, July 25. Any alternate midterm exam must be within this window.

		<h1>Topics</h1>
		<p>The midterm covers the material presented in class through the lecture on TBD.  Specifically, you will be responsible for:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Topic 1</li>
			<li>Topic 2</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The bulk of the midterm will be build on the concepts you covered in the assignments you have completed up to this point in the course.
		</p>

		<p>
			There will be four or five questions on the exam. The first question will ask you to trace a mystery function and determine runtime Big-O. The remainder will be programming tasks (where you write your solutions by hand). 
		</p>

		<p>
			Things that will <b>not</b> be on the midterm: structs, pointers, defining classes or linked lists.

		<h1>Strategies</h1>
		<p>
			Exams are exciting, and a good chance to learn. Sometimes they can feel competitive. Remember though that in the long term you aren't competing against the other people in the classroom. In fact they will probably be your teammates in the post-Stanford world. The only race is with yourself. We don't curve the exam. If everyone does a great job of demonstrating that they understand the material, everyone will get a better grade.
