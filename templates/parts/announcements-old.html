We have put a lot of effort into making this assignment a better learning experience. To that end, for the first time ever as a CS106A class you will be writing a server that can recieve internet requests.

		that is <i>supposed</i> to animate a ball that bounces off the 4 walls.  However, there
		are some bugs lurking that are preventing the program from functioning correctly.  If you can find and fix all 4 bugs, the program will give you a secret code that you can send to your Section Leader for extra credit points!  See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}assn/debugger.html">the extra credit information page</a> if you're interested in trying it out.  <strong>Update:</strong> the solution has been posted to the assignment page.</strong>

	<p>
		Graded CS106A midterms were returned after class on Wednesday, Feb. 22 via <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, an online assignment grading website; if you did not receive an email inviting you to Gradescope (check your spam folder just in case), please <a href= "mailto:troccoli@stanford.edu">email Nick, the Head TA.</a> See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}handouts/30 - Midterm Solutions.pdf">midterm solutions</a> for reference. If your scanned exam in Gradescope is difficult to read, and you would like to see your (ungraded) paper exam, you can pick it up from the CS106A filing cabinet in the "handout hangout", the lobby down the hall from Chris's office (Gates 193).  Please note that while grading we referenced both the paper and scanned versions to ensure your work was correctly graded.

		<br />
		<br />

		The median for the CS106A midterm was 41 out of 60 points. Here is the full distribution:
		<img style="width:100%" src = "{{pathToRoot}}images/general/midtermDist.png"></img>
			

		<br />
		<br />

		If you believe part of your exam was incorrectly graded, regrade requests will be accepted through <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> until <strong>Wednesday, March 1.</strong>  As part of your request, you will need to provide a short write-up of the problem(s) on your exam that you think were misgraded.  Regrade requests need to point out the aspect of the problem that was correct, but for which points were taken off.  We use a detailed rubric to grade exams, so simply requesting that an incorrect answer <i>"should be worth more points"</i> is not likely to result in additional points.  Also, we reserve the right to re-grade the whole exam to make sure there are no other grading issues present - this may result in a lower total score.

		For those who submitted section preferences by 5PM on Sunday, we have finished emailing out section assignments; as a reminder, sections start this week!  If you were unable to submit the form by the 5PM Sunday deadline, the late signup form is now open.  Click on the "Sections" tab to get to the form link.  As a reminder, SCPD students should sign up for the "SCPD section", unless you are able to attend a section in person.

		<br />
		<br />
		 
		If you would like to permanently switch into another section, there is also a link under "Sections" to request a permanent section swap.  However, because this form only allows you to request a new section by <strong>time</strong> (not location), if you would like to request a swap to a specific section for pair programming reasons, please <a href= "mailto:troccoli@stanford.edu">email Nick</a>, the Head TA.

		<br />
		<br />

		There is also a link under "Sections" to a list of all section times and locations, and a link to drop your section if you decide to unenroll from the class (this is important, as it allows another student to potentially take your section spot!).

		<br />
		<br />
