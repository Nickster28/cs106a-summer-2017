            These are the general Java style qualities that we expect your programs to have in order to receive full credit.
            Certainly it is possible to write good code that violates these guidelines, and you may feel free to contact us if you are unclear about or disagree with some of them.
            But we do expect you to follow these rules (unless there is an error in this document).
            In most professional work environments you are expected to follow that company's style standards.
            Learning to carefully obey a style guide, and writing code with a group of other developers where the style is consistent among them, are valuable job skills.

            The practices outlined on their web site are encouraged for use in CS 106A.
